They also play a role in memory storage", "The cerebellum is a wrinkled ball of tissue below and behind the rest of brain it works to combine sensory information from eyes, ears and muscles to help coordinate movement", "The brainstem links the brain to the spinal cord", " It controls many functions vital to life, such as heart rate, blood pressure and breathingarea is also important for sleep", "The brainstem links the brain to the spinal cord, it controls many functions vital to life, such as heart rate, blood pressure and breathing area is also important for sleep", "Structures deep within the brain control emotions and memories.
